puavo-os (0.1.2) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New release
  * parts/conf: add --help to puavo-conf
  * parts/conf: add -b/--type-bool flag to check if the value boolean
  * parts/conf: add library function for checking value types
  * parts/conf: fix error message format
  * Adapt puavo-conf-mkdb initramfs-setup to match what current version
    provides.
  * Fix puavo-debian-boot README.md to match the current reality.
  * parts/ltsp: client: get xbacklight parameters via puavo-conf
  * parts/ltsp: client: quote shell variable
  * puavo-debian-boot depends on puavo-conf.
  * Add "puavo-debian-boot"-package, that contains /sbin/init-puavo and
    initramfs-scripts for Puavo integration.
  * Now that we are in it, drop the "ltsp-server" package as well.
  * puavo-ltsp-client does not setup initramfs-stuff anymore (we have a
    separate package for that, incoming...).
  * Do not install ltsp-client to images.
  * Drop the ltsp-client-core dependency from puavo-ltsp-client, we are
    going to go without it.  Goodbye, LTSP, don't be sad, we had some
    good times! ;-)
  * Enable webmenu puppet-module.
  * Move setup-local-package partially to image, I think it is nicer to
    run "apt-get update" after packages in sources have changed.
  * Remove ltsp/client/init-puavo.d/98-configure-xorg, it links to ltsp-
    stuff and currently just breaks things (sets Xorg-driver to "null",
    and X is not pleased).  We probably need the driver-setting
    functionality, though.
  * Do not install custom/local packages with gdebi.  Instead, setup
    things so that apt-get can handle them.
  * gdebi apparently installs only the first deb-package on command
    line, unlike what manual page suggests.  Dealing with that...
  * Fix some package directory paths and use the buildhost architecture
    as the default build architecture, not "i386".
  * Install "locales-all" instead of "language-pack-en" on Debian
    (Debian does not have the latter package).  This is so that puppet-
    rules with UTF-8 characters work (setting LANG=en_US.UTF-8 works).
  * Still one more place to change in "Ubuntu" --> "Debian" conversion.
  * Do include lsb-release package in debootstrap phase.  Our current
    image build scripts need that, and besides, I do think it is nice in
    general.
  * Debian does not have a package named "linux-image-generic", so do
    not try to install that in bootstrap.
  * Change default image build mirrors from Ubuntu to Debian.
  * Set HOME="$$HOME" for sudo explicitly so that it works in Debian
    Jessie (and other places probably).
  * Do not try to install some software which we do not yet have in
    Debian.
  * Remove duplicate ltsp-server definition.
  * Remove duplicate ltsp-client definition.
  * Fix puavo-os package dependencies.
  * Do not depend on specific ruby version.  "ruby-bundler" -->
    "bundler".
