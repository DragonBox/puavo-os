puavo-os (0.1.3~6406f8afa3310a10c17ac6b6d09fb51c210399ae1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New release
  * parts/devscripts: include git commit id in changelog versions
  * parts/wlan: ap: accept empty wlanap_basic_rates tag
  * parts/wlan: ap: forbid 802.11b stations
  * parts/wlan: ap: configure basic rates via device tags
  * parts/ltsp: client: fix lightdm setup script to exit successfully
  * parts/ltsp: client: do not run xinit to setup the lightdm display
  * parts/conf: fix secure_getenv test
  * parts/wlan: gw: use keepalive for vtund sessions
  * parts/conf: remove debian dir
  * parts/wlan: rubylib: fix version generation
  * parts/conf: make secure_getenv an alias for __secure_getenv
  * parts/conf: use -pedantic instead -Wpedantic
  * parts/monitor: add clean target to Makefile
  * parts/hw-log: add clean target to Makefile
  * parts/autopilot: add clean target to Makefile
  * Downgrade libdb dependency 5.3 => 5.1
  * Depend on bundler or ruby-bundler, they are the same thing
  * Add puavo-freeze-system-to-image, that might be used to create a
    device image from a live system.
  * Add quite a bit more stuff to puavoimage.excludes, so that it might
    be more suitable for generating images from a live system.
  * Rename ltsp-image.excludes to puavoimage.excludes.
  * Do not try to run /usr/share/ltsp/xinitrc, it no longer exists, go
    straight to /usr/bin/xinit as it should be.
  * Setup /etc/puavo/hosttype.
  * Remove some init-puavo.d scripts that are currently broken.
  * In update-configuration, if grub-editenv fails for some reason,
    retry with a freshly created grubenv file.  Apparently grub-editenv
    can not deal with corrupted files, even those which it has likely
    corrupted itself (maybe?, truncated to zero files in case filesystem
    has been full?). This is bandaid solution, of course.
  * Fix init-puavo.
  * Remove pointless sleeps from init-puavo.
  * Run some initscripts from under /usr/share/puavo-ltsp/init-puavo.d
    (this mechanism will probably go away, but we need this for now).
  * Fix initramfs-path.
  * parts/ltsp: client get xrandr force parameter via puavo-conf
  * parts/ltsp: client: make udev-hotplug-monitor exit on error
  * parts/ltsp: client: get jetpipe parameters via puavo-conf
  * parts/ltsp: client: make udev-jetpipe exit on error
  * parts/conf: test: add tests for type checks
  * parts/conf: remove remnants of varlibdir-stuff from Makefile
  * parts/conf: treat all parameter values as strings
  * parts: use puavo-conf -b when retrieving boolean values
  * Git(6406f8afa3310a10c17ac6b6d09fb51c210399ae)

puavo-os (0.1.2) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New release
  * parts/conf: add --help to puavo-conf
  * parts/conf: add -b/--type-bool flag to check if the value boolean
  * parts/conf: add library function for checking value types
  * parts/conf: fix error message format
  * Adapt puavo-conf-mkdb initramfs-setup to match what current version
    provides.
  * Fix puavo-debian-boot README.md to match the current reality.
  * parts/ltsp: client: get xbacklight parameters via puavo-conf
  * parts/ltsp: client: quote shell variable
  * puavo-debian-boot depends on puavo-conf.
  * Add "puavo-debian-boot"-package, that contains /sbin/init-puavo and
    initramfs-scripts for Puavo integration.
  * Now that we are in it, drop the "ltsp-server" package as well.
  * puavo-ltsp-client does not setup initramfs-stuff anymore (we have a
    separate package for that, incoming...).
  * Do not install ltsp-client to images.
  * Drop the ltsp-client-core dependency from puavo-ltsp-client, we are
    going to go without it.  Goodbye, LTSP, don't be sad, we had some
    good times! ;-)
  * Enable webmenu puppet-module.
  * Move setup-local-package partially to image, I think it is nicer to
    run "apt-get update" after packages in sources have changed.
  * Remove ltsp/client/init-puavo.d/98-configure-xorg, it links to ltsp-
    stuff and currently just breaks things (sets Xorg-driver to "null",
    and X is not pleased).  We probably need the driver-setting
    functionality, though.
  * Do not install custom/local packages with gdebi.  Instead, setup
    things so that apt-get can handle them.
  * gdebi apparently installs only the first deb-package on command
    line, unlike what manual page suggests.  Dealing with that...
  * Fix some package directory paths and use the buildhost architecture
    as the default build architecture, not "i386".
  * Install "locales-all" instead of "language-pack-en" on Debian
    (Debian does not have the latter package).  This is so that puppet-
    rules with UTF-8 characters work (setting LANG=en_US.UTF-8 works).
  * Still one more place to change in "Ubuntu" --> "Debian" conversion.
  * Do include lsb-release package in debootstrap phase.  Our current
    image build scripts need that, and besides, I do think it is nice in
    general.
  * Debian does not have a package named "linux-image-generic", so do
    not try to install that in bootstrap.
  * Change default image build mirrors from Ubuntu to Debian.
  * Set HOME="$$HOME" for sudo explicitly so that it works in Debian
    Jessie (and other places probably).
  * Do not try to install some software which we do not yet have in
    Debian.
  * Remove duplicate ltsp-server definition.
  * Remove duplicate ltsp-client definition.
  * Fix puavo-os package dependencies.
  * Do not depend on specific ruby version.  "ruby-bundler" -->
    "bundler".
  * parts/wlan: ap: kill empty vtunds on PHY remove
  * parts/wlan: ap: setup bridges just-in-time
  * parts/rules: motd: use puavo-conf
  * parts/rules: xexit: use puavo-conf
  * parts/rules: remove puavo_wlan because of new era
  * parts/rules: remove graphics_stack_hacks because of new era
