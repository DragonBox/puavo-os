Here are the post-installation configuration for puavo-ltsp-bootserver
package.  The puavo-ltsp-bootserver package it used to configure Puavo
bootservers, but unfortunately some configurations need to be slightly
edited by-hand for everything to work correctly.  Some suggestions
can safely be skipped if the corresponding functionality is not needed.

These settings have been tested with Ubuntu version 12.04.


Cups
----

To setup cups to work with Puavo certificates do edit
/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.cupsd to contain the line:

  /etc/puavo/certs/* r,

Also do edit the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file to contain the lines:

  ServerCertificate /etc/puavo/certs/host.crt
  ServerKey /etc/puavo/certs/host.key

Do restart apparmor and cups server:

  sudo service apparmor restart
  sudo service cups restart
